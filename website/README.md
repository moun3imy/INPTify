# INPTify
This is the REST API code for INPT notifications system.
### GOALS

This system will enable different entities inside INPT to deliver notifications to appropriate users.

By enities we mean Clubs communication cells, different departments heads, the administration board, etc..
The type of notifications available is:
  1. Simple posts (with title and body).
  2. Exam marks (every student receives his mark only).
  3. (feel free to suggest more :grin:)

For each entity, there will be admin accounts responsible of handling the notifications types and content
